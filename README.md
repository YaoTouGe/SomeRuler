A simple pixel ruler for Desktop.

This project was initially inspired by [Ruler](https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=ruler) developed by Jeff Key.
I re-implemented it with Qt, and did some major improvements.

Features & usage:

- Cross platform (tested under Windows 10 and macOS Catalina +)
- High DPI support
- Rotation support (with angle readings): drag the circle handle upward or downward
- Resizing: drag the circle handle horizontally
- Length reading: click on the ticks
- Reset: double click on the circle handle
- Hiding: press ESC key

Stable builds can be downloaded from [Releases Page](https://github.com/ZhujinLi/SomeRuler/releases).

Developed with Qt 5.15.2 as it's the version supported on Felgo CI/CD platform.
